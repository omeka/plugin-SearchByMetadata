# plugin-SearchByMetadata
Omela Classic plugin that allows admins to configure metadata fields to link to a search for Items/Collections with the same field value.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "SearchByMetadata".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## ToDo
Add logic to merge results (= clicking on a link shows results both from Items and Collections; could need to make available another Browse page, or a Search one). Behaviour has to be optional (specifi option already foreseen for configuration).

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

## Troubleshooting
See online issues on the <a href="https://github.com/omeka/plugin-SearchByMetadata/issues" target="_blank">plugin issues</a> page on GitHub.
